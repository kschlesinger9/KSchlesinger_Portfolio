# Outline
## Summary of Project
For my final project, I'm looking to explore a dataset that I've yet to have time to unpack at work but have been anxiously awaiting having the opportunity to explore: the 2018 Make My Trip Count data. This is the second time that this comprehensive transportation survey has been conducted over the last five years (the first occurring in 2015) by the Green Building Alliance and with the support of a number of partner organizations/agencies, including BikePGH, Port Authority, Allegheny Conference, Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership (where I work!), Healthy Ride, Oakland Transportation Management Association, and many others. 

## Project Structure & Story Arc

## Initial Sketch

## Explanation of Make My Trip Count Data
For some context, the Make My Trip Count survey is one of many versions of transportation surveys developed across the country that are used to assess commuter mode split and better understand commuters transportation needs. As mentioned above, this is the second time this survey has been conducted and shared to an audience across western Pennsylvania with a focus on residents living in Allegheny, Washington, ad Westmoreland counties. 

Because this dataset is so dense (it quite literally has over 5,000,000 cells of data), I'm going to focus on looking at the home zip codes of all the respondents (n=20,081) and see the aggregated counts for what neighborhod/location they travel to for work or school (options to select from: Downtown, North Shore, Oakland, Bluff, Strip District, Lawrenceville, East Liberty, or other).
