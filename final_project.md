# Outline
## Summary of Project
For my final project, I'm looking to explore a dataset that I've yet to have time to unpack at work but have been anxiously awaiting having the opportunity to explore: the 2018 Make My Trip Count data. This is the second time that this comprehensive transportation survey has been conducted over the last five years (the first occurring in 2015) by the Green Building Alliance and with the support of a number of partner organizations/agencies, including BikePGH, Port Authority, Allegheny Conference, Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership (where I work!), Healthy Ride, Oakland Transportation Management Association, and many others.

## Explanation of Make My Trip Count Data
For some context, the Make My Trip Count survey is one of many versions of transportation surveys developed across the country that are used to assess commuter mode split and better understand commuters transportation needs. For many cities, this data is the best and only way of understanding what transportation modes people are using regularly and to better develop metrics for striving to achieve a higher walk/bike/transit mode split vs. driving. As mentioned above, this is the second time this survey has been conducted and shared with an audience across western Pennsylvania with a focus on residents living in Allegheny, Washington, and Westmoreland counties. Because this dataset is so dense (it quite literally has over 5,000,000 cells of data), I'm going to focus on looking at the home zip codes of all the respondents (n=20,081) and see the aggregated counts for what neighborhod/location they travel to for work or school (options to select from: Downtown, North Shore, Oakland, Bluff, Strip District, Lawrenceville, East Liberty, or other). I've already started to play with the data in Excel using a pivot table to get me started on thinking through the message and overall tone I want to send the audience about this topic. 

This dataset is not currently publicly available, but will be hosted on Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center, like the 2015 version, within the next few months. For reference, here's a link to the 2015 dataset: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/make-my-trip-count-2015

## Method & Medium for Visualization
Currently, I am still in the process of determining what medium I plan to use for my final project. It's very possible I will end up using Shorthand to host my project, but there's a chance that I will also explore using Tableau or Esri's Story Map (I have a lot of experience working with ArcMap/ArcGIS Online, but have never used Esri's Story Map for displaying geospatial data). 

There are certainly pros and cons with each of these options, as well as some limitations I need to weigh before making a final decision about the best medium method to utilize for this project. As I mentioned above in my data section, I have already begun exploring the specific features of the data I'm planning to use in my final project via a pivot table and chart to better visualize what I'm looking to accomplish with this data.
