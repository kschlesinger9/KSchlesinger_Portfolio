# Final Project Part III

In an effort to not duplicate prior completed work, I'm including the links to part I and part II's relevant outline,
descriptions, wireframes, and more below. Please reference these links as needed to see the full "behind the scenes" look
at the development of my project.

## Final Project Part III
As I began putting my final project together, I quickly realized that I needed some additional feedback to hone and refine my
charts, maps, and overall content. I gathered a few new friends and colleagues to help give me some input on about half of my story map built out and below is some of the feedback, both positive and room for improvement, I heard that helped me reach the final product:

Positives | Room for Improvement
------------ | -------------
Overall content sends a very strong message | Add a third call to action involving individual action and can be reasonably accomplished
Good choice of style for charts/maps for the selected data| Avoid using excessive amounts of data to reduce intimidation factor
Story line is intuitive and easy to follow | Substitute some of the text for videos/visual aids when possible

After receiving this feedback, I completed the remainder of my story map and also tweaked existing content accordingly. Throughout the process of developing this story map, I envisioned that the audience for this page would be the general public, specifically residents who commute into Downtown Pittsburgh from across the 10-county region in southwestern Pennsylvania (Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Butler, Fayette, Green, Indiana, Lawrence, Washington, and Westmoreland). In addition to this being geared towards the residents and commuters from southwestern Pennsylvania, this page could also be used by transportation advocacy based organizations in the City of Pittsburgh and surrounding municipalities in order to accomplish local and state level advocacy "call to actions", recruit commuters to complete future surveys or public comments, and help to demystify the complexities around the value of considering one's own transportation mode choice and mode split when commuting. 

One of the things I found most difficult while finalizing my story map was translating some of the more transportation wonky terms and topics I referred to throughout (mode split, induced demand, etc.) and breaking these down into digestible, yet still informative and intriguiging messages. One person I received some final feedback from suggested that rather than solely rely on describing things in industry terminology or in text based format, I should consider ways to translate my message into visuals, videos, pictures, or other stimulating and tangible means to convey my message. As a result of this advice, I decided to design the initial section on transportation mode choice and mode split entirely around using videos and images with some supportive text to give the visual aids some additional context and framing to really send the message home. Hopefully, between the video from LA metro and the iconic mode choice comparison on the street help to send a strong, clear message to my intended audience. 

Overall, I found that the design of my overall story map was far more challenging to accomplish (thanks to my perfectionist and obsessive tendancies) than finalizing my data visualizations. From the point of determining my data source and goal of the project, I quickly figured out that I wanted to have simple, yet striking visuals to convey Downtown mode split and the total number of survey respondents by destination. For the maps, I also knew that I wanted to visualize the top 20-30 home zip codes for Downtown commuters and to avoid using dense data tables to show this information.
