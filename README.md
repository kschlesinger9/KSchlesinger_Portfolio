# About Me + What I Hope to Learn & Take Away from this Class
Hi there! My name is Kathryn Schlesinger and I'm a second year past-time Master of Public Management (MPM) student. By day, I work full-time for the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership as the Operations and Outreach Manager on the Mobility team and focus on providing project management, stakeholder outreach and engagement, operational and technical support, and public realm planning initiatives across the Golden Triangle. When I'm not at work or in class/doing homework (we all know that's rather infrequent), I enjoy soaking in Frick Park on long hikes, spending time with my partner and our two adorable cats (Pluto + Ezio, photo pending), and eating tacos/other delicious food with friends and loved ones.

Last summer, my friend Lea decided to take this course and because she's a great friend and knows my love of visualizing data, she shared weekly updates with me on the progress of the class and most importantly, the development of her final project. Although her class was structured differently and involved similar, but different assignments, I followed the development of her final project which involved the creation of a Tableau map and interactive chart visualizing food deserts across Allegheny County. I quickly found myself reminiscing over all of the past data analysis and GIS work I spent a considerable amount of time doing in my last job and knew that despite having experience with this topic, this would be a great class for me to take. 

Fast forward to today and here we are! Moving into week two, I look forawrd to dedicating the next few weeks of Wednesday evenings and weekend time to honing and refining my existing skills in creating thoughtful and intentional data visualization strategies that can be applied to my work at the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership, projects and assignments in school, and for my own purposes to regularly apply to my day-to-day life.

## Data Visualization Critique #2 - Version 2.0
Overall Observations about Visualization: 
Regardless of the industry you work in, I’m sure many of us have come across some pretty bad data visualizations, from your coworker’s not-so-great and questionably deceptive chart he/she showed you last week to the poorly developed infographic you saw at a recent meeting that made you want to curl up and cry. There’s probably even been times many of us have created poor data visualizations and not even realized it. Being equipped with a few basic, yet key techniques for spotting bad data visualizations will become vitally important for improving your own visualization skills, but also to become more aware of who the audience is, why the information matters, and what the most important message is to summarize and encapsulate in this visualization. 

After working in the nonprofit industry for 5+, I’ve started to notice a pattern at conferences, workshops, and events – people love using infographics, pictures, charts and graphs, but seldom use these tools effectively. I’ve spent a lot of time looking at local and state reports in my last two roles and I’ve stumbled across a ton of examples of visualizations that have left me feeling a bit perplexed. One of the things that bothers me most is when I see a list jammed full of data, but it’s displayed in a way that doesn’t really help the audience understand what all these numbers mean when they’re broken down. 

Take the list of data in Appendix E of the City of Pittsburgh’s 2019 Capital Budget: Capital Budget History (https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/4499_2019_Capital_Budget.pdf). This chart is packed full of incredibly useful information about the City’s Capital Budget and even displays historical data as a comparative measure to the current year. But no one can easily or quickly decipher anything from information, especially data, displayed this way – most people are visual learners and respond better when they see data displayed in shapes, rather than numbers. So let’s break it down and help everyone to visualize this data in a more tangible and practical way. Note: Due to some of the limitations of the functionality of infogram axis changes, I wasn't able to space things out more but this is definitely an issue I immediately realized when I finished creating this).

Considering this from the perspective of DHS staff is more challenging, especially when asked to summarize the entire report into one infographic. To touch on several different pieces of the report here, I focused on providing some of the key data and emphasized the graphic with the support of additional text/graphics.

In this scenario, I spent a significant amount of time culling through the report searching for the most significant statistics. Eventually, after getting frustrated with reading adn re-reading sections over and over, I decided to take a different angle and choose a theme or focus point of the report to highlight. After this exercise, I decided to focus on storytelling, in a simplistic, yet powerful way, through focusing on the impact of the poor conditions on children at the Border Patrol Facilities. By choosing to focus on children, this approach will likely appeal to a broader audience across the U.S. and beyond, and will be a way to create an instantaneous emotional response, even from those who don't have their own children. Ultimately, I'm hopeful that this approach would have a great impact on people and generate more attention to this topic. Final note: I initially overlooked it, but the first statistic is a little misleading since technically, the 2,669 children are associated with five Border Patrol Facilities. However, as an ethical person, I'd make it a point to include this bit of information in the body of my article for some additional clarity and transparency.
