This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data Class during summer 2019 at CMU! This page is a work in progress and will be updated on a frequent basis over the next few weeks. 

# About Me + What I Hope to Learn & Take Away from this Class
Hi there! My name is Kathryn Schlesinger and I'm a second year past-time Master of Public Management (MPM) student. By day, I work full-time for the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership as the Operations and Outreach Manager on the Mobility team and focus on providing project management, stakeholder outreach and engagement, operational and technical support, and public realm planning initiatives across the Golden Triangle. When I'm not at work or in class/doing homework (we all know that's rather infrequent), I enjoy soaking in Frick Park on long hikes, spending time with my partner and our two adorable cats (Pluto + Ezio, photo pending), and eating tacos/other delicious food with friends and loved ones.

Last summer, my friend Lea decided to take this course and because she's a great friend and knows my love of visualizing data, she shared weekly updates with me on the progress of the class and most importantly, the development of her final project. Although her class was structured differently and involved similar, but different assignments, I followed the development of her final project which involved the creation of a Tableau map and interactive chart visualizing food deserts across Allegheny County. I quickly found myself reminiscing over all of the past data analysis and GIS work I spent a considerable amount of time doing in my last job and knew that despite having experience with this topic, this would be a great class for me to take. 

Fast forward to today and here we are! Moving into week two, I look forawrd to dedicating the next few weeks of Wednesday evenings and weekend time to honing and refining my existing skills in creating thoughtful and intentional data visualization strategies that can be applied to my work at the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership, projects and assignments in school, and for my own purposes to regularly apply to my day-to-day life.
