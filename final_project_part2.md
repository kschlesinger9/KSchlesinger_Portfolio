# Final Project - Part II: Script, Questions, and User Feedback Protocol 

## Script
Hi (insert person’s name), I’ve chosen to reach out to you for feedback on my final project for my Telling Stories with Data class because you have a proven track record of being detail oriented, creative, and thoughtful and your feedback will be incredibly valuable for the progress of my project. Without going into too much detail, since my wireframe should ideally speak for itself, the goal of you reviewing my wireframe is to determine if my story is cohesive, clear and accurate to what I am envisioning and intended. Rather than waste any more time giving background information, let’s jump right into this! 

## Questions
Note: these questions will be used more as a guide since my goal for these brief interviews is to solicit feedback in a light, conversational way.
1.	When you look at this story, what are the main points you’re taking away? 
2.	Is the layout or structure straightforward to interpret or is it difficult to decipher and understand?
3.	Based on the story, is there a sufficient amount of data visualizations to help break down this topic and make it straightforward enough?
4.	Are the proposed data visualization styles appropriate for the data that’s intended to be displayed? Answer to the best of your judgement from the sample of data provided. 
5.	How can I do a better job of incorporating an appropriate color scheme into the text? Are there specific areas of the story that you see needing to be called out by color that aren’t currently?
