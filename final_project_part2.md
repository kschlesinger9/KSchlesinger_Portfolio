# Final Project - Part II: Script, Questions, and User Feedback Protocol 

## Script
Hi (insert person’s name), I’ve chosen to reach out to you for feedback on my final project for my Telling Stories with Data class because you have a proven track record of being detail oriented, creative, and thoughtful and your feedback will be incredibly valuable for the progress of my project. Without going into too much detail, since my wireframe should ideally speak for itself, the goal of you reviewing my wireframe is to determine if my story is cohesive, clear and accurate to what I am envisioning and intended. Rather than waste any more time giving background information, let’s jump right into this! 

## Questions
Note: these questions will be used more as a guide since my goal for these brief interviews is to solicit feedback in a light, conversational way.
1.	When you look at this story, what are the main points you’re taking away? 
2.	Is the layout or structure straightforward to interpret or is it difficult to decipher and understand?
3.	Based on the story, is there a sufficient amount of data visualizations to help break down this topic and make it straightforward enough?
4.	Are the proposed data visualization styles appropriate for the data that’s intended to be displayed? Answer to the best of your judgement from the sample of data provided. 
5.	How can I do a better job of incorporating an appropriate color scheme into the text? Are there specific areas of the story that you see needing to be called out by color that aren’t currently?

## Final Wireframe

## User Feedback Protocol Overview 
When setting out to find people to review my wireframe, I knew that I needed to identify 3 people that would each have different backgrounds and levels of exposure to working and feeling comfortable with data. Once carefully weighing 5-7 potential interviewees, I narrowed in on three people which included a coworker, a family member, and a friend. 

I created this wireframe intending the primary, targeted audience to be the general public living across the Greater Pittsburgh Region. Ultimately, I envisioned this being a toolkit, used for both educatiional and advocacy purposes, to direct attention to how people commute, where people are commuting to and from, and how commuting choices directly influence regional transportation projects. 

After showing my initial wireframe to these three people, I heard several common themes that resulted in me adding some things and removing others:

1.	Using something close to the color scheme from the Make my Trip Count logo is a nice touch, but be consistent with the font, style, and size of text when incorporating colors
2.	While there was unanimity that the style of my wireframe was cool, there were places where arrows were missing between items that made it more difficult to follow and interpret. (Plus, it was also pointed out that this would make it harder on me when I started to design the final form of my project)
3.	For my call to action/big takeaways, the two messages were strong, but needed some refining and “demystifying” of industry words and phrases used that left some feeling confused
4. Portions of the wireframe that were data heavy sometimes lacked enough supporting text to provide sufficient context, especially for those who don't work in the transportation industry

Through the process of refining my wireframe (and obsessing over tweaking everything), I realized that there are many places where I will need to expand on the amount of information and context provided to help tell a more complete story. Overall, this process has helped me to begin visualizing the content, flow, and structure that my final project will take.
